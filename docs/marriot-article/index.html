           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p>At the tail-end of my journey with The Global Tech Experience, I was tasked with completing a simulated project focused on user research on the leading whole-home rental service Marriott Bonvoy Hotels & Villas. This project was designed in collaboration with Publicus Sapient to replicate the development of digital products. 
            Through thorough market research and user interviews, I gained valuable insights into user needs, pain points, and areas for improvement. This experience provided valuable exposure to real-world research methodologies and strategic analysis, despite its simulated nature.
           </p>


           <h2>Understanding the Market</h2>
           <p> To gain a comprehensive understanding of the whole-home rental service market, I conducted a thorough review of the user experience on competing websites that closely align with Marriott's objectives. 
            The selected websites included: </p>

            <div class="row text-center">
              
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                <img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" alt="">
              
                <p class="p-md-4 p-4 fs-5">AirBnb</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                <img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" alt="">
                <p class="p-md-4 p-4 fs-5">VRBO</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12"><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" alt="">
                <p class="p-md-4 p-4 fs-5">Wimdu</p></div>
            
              </div>

            <p> Through my review of these webpages, I identified 5 essential product features that significantly enhance the user experience:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Filter homes by unique identifiers (e.g. Historical Homes, OMG!, Containers)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thorough overview on hover that includes a photo gallery, popular amenities, and accomodations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Search rentals based on accomodations available (Pet-friendly, Wi-Fi)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Utilize extensive filtering options such as nearby activities, Min-Max price range slider, accessibility, and discounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pricing toggle to show total price dependent on check in/out dates within search results.
                </li>
              </ul>

              Although it is easy to take these features for granted, 
              their implementation is simple and ensures that users have
               the best experience when planning their next vacation.
    


            </p>


           <h2>User Research</h2>
          For user research, we analyzed interview recordings alongside survey results of 3,181 Marriott Bonvoy
          members. This combined research revealed a key insight: over 66% of members crave inspiration for vacation planning.
          However, the website
          struggles to address this need. Users discussed challenges filtering by specific criteria and found the navigation
          cumbersome during the interviews.
          While the website caters well to those who know exactly where they want to stay, it falls short for those seeking
          inspiration. With this analysis, we found a strong desire for a more user-friendly experience. Participants in the interviews
          suggested improvements to make finding inspiration easier.
          These include a user-friendly search function with clear categories, responsive menus for easier navigation, and more
          detailed property pages featuring multiple images, reviews,
          amenity listings, and showcasing popular properties. These suggestions once implemented create an experience in line with Marriott Bonvoy's biggest competitors. 


          <h2>Define and Prototype</h2>

          With our research finished and priorities established, it is time to prototype features that will enhance the user experience. These features include:
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              A popup modal on page load asking the user where they want to go.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          For this prototype I opted to use Figma and will provide a link to the Figma project here. 
          
          However for the sake of this post, I will have my slides below.

          The features in this prototype include:
          <ul>

            <li>
              A popup modal on page load asking the user where they want to go.
            </li>
          </ul>
